	<br>
	<br>
	<p align="center" >If our project were to be backed by an external group/organisation, then we would need the maximum amount of 6 people to help develop the application. Assuming our original group were able to complete all our initial set tasks, then we would need more people filling in for different roles. Firstly, at this stage, we need to discuss what our application now requires from us to improve it further for the users and us as a group. Our original group’s skills and knowledge involving programming and design were very limited due to our minimal experience, thus we would need at least two software engineers, a data analyst, a user experience specialist, a project manager, and a website designer.</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p align="center" >to better improve the chatterbot, we would use the funding’s to hire two software engineers. This includes its recognition of what the user is trying to ask for, its efficiency of remembering previous messages and using context. This is so that the user does not have to repeat themselves for the bot to understand. These are important details that they would work alongside the user experience specialist to minimise user frustration. These engineers would need to be able to develop on top of our previous code written in Java, therefore, they need to be specialized in that language for us to be more efficient with deadlines. Hiring engineers that do not know java would mean that we would have to re-do all our code in their desired language. Another qualification needed is that they need to be skilled with programming with a partner. With the help of the project manager, they would need to be able to assign each other’s tasks that suits their skills and understanding of java, thus needing to be cooperative with one another. Our project would preferably choose software engineers that have at least 4 years of experience in the job and a bachelor’s degree in said field.</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p align="center" >This new group would need one person working on our data analysts. This helps our software engineers further understand how our test users are using the application, allowing us to reflect on what features they do or do not care about. They would evaluate our data in a way that would help us discover information, including what types of groups mostly use the product, how often do they use it, how satisfied are they etc. This also helps are software engineers with figuring out what features are mostly used and need to be optimised. The main skills needed with someone involved in this position is understanding human behavior, interpreting it, and explaining it to the rest of us in our language. Communicating to us with reports and graphs is essential for us to take use of the person in this role as they give us an understanding of how our users are using the application. A job like this does not require too much, however having previous experience in this area is needed as we don’t want to risk hiring someone that may lead us to missing out on crucial information. A master’s degree in analytics is needed for this role.</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p align="center" >With the proper funding, securing a user experience specialist would be very beneficial to the look and feel of the application. Highly skilled designers understand the user’s needs and can educate the rest of the team on what can be left out of the user interface, and what needs to be added in. This is important as a poor user experience can often lead to losing users, and then in turn, money. It is also a necessity as we want our users to be able to understand what this product is and to be able to fully utilise its functionality. An example of this is if we were to add a really nice and helpful feature to the application, it would become redundant to add it into the program if the user is unable to figure out how to use it and access that feature.</p>
	<br>
	<br>
    <br>
	<p align="center" >A project manager would help us ensure that everyone in the group is communicating with each other as our work will often need to be intertwined with one another. Mainly, Software engineers need to work with the ux specialist, who then needs to communicate with our data analyst as these roles need information that can only be gathered by the other team members. Our project manager would have to have the skills of a leader, such as confidence and a strive for success. This person needs to be able to identify problems and inefficiencies within the group and would then need to be capable of taking action in a timely manner that won’t disrupt the flow of the project. This manager needs to be someone that the group can respect and listen too, for if no one cares about what this person has to say, then it is unlikely that anything will change. In order for someone to obtain these attributes, they need to have prior experience working as a project manager in other projects so they can use that knowledge gained from their experience, to better help them become a good fit for the team.</p>
