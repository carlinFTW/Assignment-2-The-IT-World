	<h2 align="center" >Carlin's Reflection</h2>
	<p align="center" >Our Intro to I.T group 'Gold chains' was able to successfully work together in order to finish this assignment. The work was divided equally to each team member and everyone was able to accomplish their tasks without any major problems. The quality of the work remained high as we had a good amount of time to complete it and we were always communicating with each other. One key area that has room for improvement was the speed in which we completed our tasks. This would benefit the group website as the earlier everything is completed, the more time we have to develop the website itself to be properly formatted to suite everyone's work. The most surprising aspect to this assignment was how well we were able to do it with the current restrictions in today's society. Even though we were unable to discuss or work face-to-face, we still managed to do it with the help of conference calling apps such as 'Microsoft Teams,' and services such as GitHub. One lesson learnt about working with groups is that it teaches you about individuality and shows you how everyone is able to do their work in their own unique ways. This includes their efficiency, tools and attitude towards the assignment and allows us to evaluate which personalities works well together and which ones do not. Our GitHub logs accurately reflects each team members work as we all divided our work as evenly as possible.</p>

	<h2 align="center" >Dawn's Reflection</h2>
	<p align="center" >From this assignment, starting from week five, it's been weeks of working with the group and it's members. In general, the group works and communicates well with one other, the work is taken up and given responsibly. Individually, Carlin leads the group and it's work, in a loose but effective manner. His contributions to the project outside of his leadership, is plentiful as he picks up</p>
