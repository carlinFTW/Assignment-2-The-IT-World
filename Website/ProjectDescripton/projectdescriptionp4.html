        <h2 align="center">Testing</h2>
        <p align="center">Things to be tested<p>
        <p align="center">Security testing</p>
        <p align="center">Software testing</p>
                <br>
            <p align="center">Software testing would be very important in this project where we need to test the functional and non functional aspects of the application. This step is crucial in refining the software from any problems such as bugs and also removing redundant lines of codes to improve the performance of the app.<p>
        <br>
<p align="center">Black box and White box testing</p>
        <p align="center">Security Testing to check for any vulnerability of the application data. We should ensure that our app is not leaking any personal information of the user if we decided to record user personal data<p>
        <br>
<h2 align="center">Emulation in IDE:</h2>
<p align="center">There are several tests we could do before deploying a beta testing of this application which first can be done in an emulator for example, In Xcode programmers could emulate an Iphone and run the application they created in it. It won’t be the real life thing but functionally it is great to test any flaws in the code.</p>
        <br>
<h2 align="center">Usability testing</h2>
<p align="center">The tests that will be developed and used for the project are usability tests and surveys, the product will be tested by potential users through, a prior survey, a usability test and finally a post-survey. From the results, success will only be considered when the product usability is high and no major issues or criticisms are shared. When it comes to recruiting participants, they will be found through advertisements and will require 15 participants. The user testers will be required to have an interest in attending movie cinemas on a casual or regular basis.</p>
        <br>
<h2 align="center">Online testing</h2>
<p align="center">This testing will be very simple to set up. First we will need a server that hosts the app and then we will find some people to distribute the shareable link to potential customers. After they have received the link they can start to try out the app based on their daily use. This can be called as beta testing as well since we are mostly looking for user comments and suggestions for the improvement of the app</p>
