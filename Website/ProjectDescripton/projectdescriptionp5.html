        <p align="center">This AI project, like all projects have the potential for accidents and risks when it comes to its development and release. One such risk is that when it is truly implemented, it would little to no relevance or use to its users. Its focused function within the cinema industry, renders the chat bot, useless when other fields and industries  are considered or questioned. The limited expertise would cause the product to look redundant when compared to other such as amazon’s echo, or Google’s Alexa. Hence, so little, or no monetary benefits would be reaped from the project as an outcome. In order to, mediate this risk, extra research and features should be implemented into the product to add relevance and variety to Popper. By doing this, the product would have more use in the user’s daily life than it did with its limited use.</p> 
        <br>
        <br>
        <p align="center">Another risk is, even if a known IDE or coding language is used, the project may be harder to achieve than anticipated. The incorrect coding language could be used, so a more appropriate coding language would have to be learnt and implemented, which, would make the development harder given the limited experience such a language. This also delays the project’s progress in the project plan. The same could said of the chosen IDE, if the IDE fails to meet the requirements of the project. A new one would have chosen and used, but still require learning about how the IDE works. This would once again, delay the progress and would force the all other tasks to be moved forward or changed accordingly. One way to prevent this, is by further researching the most appropriate, reliable IDE and coding language. This way, it decreases the chances of the need to change the use IDE or coding language and hence it prevents time from spent relearning or learning a new language or software.</p>

        <h2 align="centre">Group Processes and Communications</h2>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p align="centre"> In regards to communication, our team will be using mainly Microsoft Teams for managing files and making changes to the group, and facebook messenger or Discord will act as the secondary communication because sometimes most of us won’t be online on Teams and would rather be contacted via those two platforms. This will be confusing at first but there will be a better flow than waiting for someone to respond on Teams to be online. If a informal meeting does occur, they will be recorded via a word document and kept in file as evidence of meeting.</p>
