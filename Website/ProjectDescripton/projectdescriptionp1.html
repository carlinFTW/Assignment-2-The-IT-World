        <h2 align="center">Project Idea</h2>
        <br>
        <p align="center" >Amongst the weeks of discussion about the group's shared project, has reached its conclusion. It has been agreed that the chosen idea will be an AI assistant that will be able to collect relative information for the user inquiry. The AI chatbot is aimed to help users find information about the currently shown movies, their corresponding movie tickets prices and cinema locations. Its production has come from AI assistants such as Google's Alexa and Amazon's echo. They have shown us what we can achieve with them, so it is only fair that we become opportunists and take this opportunity and use it to learn and expand our knowledge of such technology. It will act as a chance to learn through practical involvement and teamwork.</p>
        <br>
        <p align="center" >The chatbot would be called poppy, for its casual but friendly association with popcorn. Its features will include features that users decide what movies they would like to watch based on the basic information of the movie's plot, setting, characters, actors, directors and time. It would work as follows:</p>
        <br>
        <p align="center" >To make this project work, programs such as eclipse, a general internet browser and some form of cloud storage. Regarding, equipment, a type of computer or laptop for all members to work on will also be needed. Eclipse is used to allow either the group or specific members to create and develop the assistant using Java, as an extra function. It would also allow the allocated member/s to be notified whenever there is a syntax error in the current code. An internet browser would give the group a source of information that could be used to help overcome java exceptions, learn new java techniques, and research on the current cinematic movie releases. Cloud storage software such as GitHub would be useful as it, would allow all the members of the group to have access to the progressive code and any other documents that are to be worked on.</p>
        <br>
        <p align="center" >Hence, from the need tools and technology, it can be said that the needed skills would be to most importantly being able to program using the correct coding language. Therefore, the coding will have to be done in java. Another skill would be to have some knowledge of an IDE (integrated development environment), so the program can be tested when needed.</p>
        <br>
        <h2 align="center">Aim</h2>
        <br>
        <p align="center" >The aim of our group “Gold Chains” is too develop an application which helps alleviate common
        issues that arise when organising to go out to the cinemas. This is going to help users of all age
        brackets to establish a better understanding of the movies they are interested in seeing. This aim
        was established by the group as many of us were able to relate to the fact that we enjoy having all of
        our needed information to be granted to us in the once place. Currently, most cinema websites
        don’t offer its users the ability to be able to do everything within the one website or application. For
        example, seeing set times, trailers, accessing reviews from both critics and the general audiences,
        etc. To be able to accomplish this, our group needs to set smaller goals which in turn will allow us to
        deliver the appropriate information to our end user. Specifically, figuring out how to pull information
        in a timely manner from other cinema websites is a crucial step for us to achieve this aim. This is
        important as our users will need to know specific information when chatting to our chatterbot. This
        mainly includes the set times the movies that will be playing in their cinema of choice. This goal
        comes with the question of the legalities involved with taking information from other websites
        without their permission. If the application were to be just based in a small town, with specific
        granted permissions from the local cinemas, then this wouldn’t be an issue. However, if this
        application were to go national or global, then issues in those areas might arise and would need to
        be addressed. Leading us to our next smaller goal of ensuring that there are no legal risks involved
        with making this application, and to consult with professionals in these fields.</p>
        <br>
        <h2 align="center">Goal</h2>
        <br>
        <p align="center" >Our group’s main goal is to better develop upon our skills with coding in order to be able to succeed
        with this application. Everyone in our group has had experience in both coding and developing
        applications, however, all of us have no prior knowledge in understanding the basics of how to make
        a chatterbot. If we were to start developing the application today, we would be able to accomplish
        building the user interface and most of the chatterbot features, but may not be successful with
        getting the appropriate replies from our bot. This is due to chatterbots code being based on “if this
        then that” type of coding, which we do have a level of understanding towards, but are not advanced
        enough coders to be able to implement it properly throughout all of the application. This goal
        branches off to all areas that involve programming within our project, such as getting updates on set
        times, being able to determine spelling errors made by the user, making a robust application that
        won’t crash etc. This is both the most important part of the entire project and also should be at our
        highest priority over the other goals, for we need to develop the skills needed to actually make this
        application run properly. If we ran out of time and resources, then everyone in the group would be
        prioritising this. This is due to the fact that our other goals are not as necessary in completing as they
        do not determine whether or not if the user will be able to run the application. Allowing our users to
        at least download an application that meets most of its requirements is more important than
        ensuring the smaller features, legalities and so on are met at a high standard. This is true even
        though all of our goals are important and should be addressed throughout the process of our
        project.</p>
