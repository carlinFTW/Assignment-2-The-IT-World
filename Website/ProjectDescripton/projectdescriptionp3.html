        <h2 align="center">Roles</h2>
        <br>
        <p align="center">Each team member of our group has specific roles that tailor towards their strengths and desires.
        Due to our group consisting of only three people, we made the decision to diversify our roles in
        multiple different areas as we may need to work on some parts together, or by ourselves. If we were
        to specify specifically what each other’s roles are, then our team member Dawn Aquino would be
        the lead user interface designer as she has expressed her strong skills in that key area. That is not to
        say that she would be doing all the designing, we as a team would make decisions together if she
        believes she needs feedback or input by the team. Alfred Hutomo and I, Carlin, would be the lead
        software developers in that we would be writing the application in java. We both have experience
        with coding in java, making it a suitable role for us as Dawn is not confident in that area. As everyone
        has talents and skills to contribute to the overall project, there are no real team leaders as we all
        would participate in evenly distributing the work. As the team leader however, it is my job to make
        sure everyone is set on task and to make sure everyone’s ideas are heard by the whole group. It is an
        extra level of work that could be performed by anyone us.</p>
        <br>
        <h2 align="center">Scope and limits</h2>
        <br>
        <p align="center">Given the large range of cinemas that exist in international countries, this product is most likely going to be exclusive to Australian users only, as there would to many movie theatres  to consider and to hold information for;  if the product were made for global consumption. To refine it further, Popper will only hold and relay information regarding the main three movie theatres in Australia, which are Hoyts, Event and Village cinemas. As there will be enough data to proof its use and function to users. </p>
        <br>
        <p align="center">One of the features of the product is, that it uses  offers directions to the cinema of interest however it will only show directions of the place of interest not anything else. It will not function to serve directions to everything as google maps does. As well as  Popper’s ability to relay information would also be limited, it would only have data regarding movie theatres and movies so hence anything out the realm of the movies industry would be a limit for the product as no data is stored or accessed for such information.</p>
        <br>
        <h2 align="center">Tools and Technologies</h2>
        <br>
        <h3 align="center">IDE Options:</h3>
        <ul align="center"> 
        <li>Visual Code Studio (Windows) Version 1.44.2</li>
        <li>Eclipse IDE (Windows and MacOs) Version 4.17</li>
        <li>Xcode (MacOs) Version 11.4.1</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p align="center">Web browser of choice is the Google Chrome Version Version 83.0.4103.61 because of its stable built and many functionality for development<p></p>
        <br>
        <h3 align="center">Hardware: </h3>
        <br>
        <p align="center">Each developer might need any type of computer that is compatible and can edit the codes with an IDE mentioned above.</p>
        <br>
        <ul align="center"> <b>Minimum Requirement:</b>
        <li>Dual core CPU</li>
        <li>8 GB of RAM</li>
        <li>Internet connection wired or wireless</li>
        <li>Can run using current Windows or MacOs version</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p align="center">For testing, the hardware we need is a mobile device to test our app mainly we need at least one IOS device and also one Android Device. This will let the application tested for compatibility before starting a larger scale testing. Preferably models from 2020</p>
        <br>
        <h3 align="center">Version Control Software</h3>
        <br>
        <p align="center"><b>GitHub</b></p>
        <br>
        <p align="center">We will be using Github to control our code version and backed up to the cloud. All of the programmers that will be dealing with the development will be much easier getting the files if they need to make progress. </p>
        <br>
        <p align="center">We need to decide if we need the GitHub for teams which will give us benefits to host a private repository. The basic version is free but if there will be more developers working on this we might need to push towards the $4 per user/ month  subscription for a bigger number of people.</p>
