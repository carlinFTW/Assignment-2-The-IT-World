        <h2 align="center">Plan and progress</h2>
        <br>
        <p align="center">Our team is embarking on a project which will assist users in organising their outings to the cinemas.
        Our group “Gold Chains” consists of two programmers and one designer that will be utilizing their
        skills to create certain aspects of the program, eventually resulting in a finished product. We are
        trying to achieve our main aim of making an application that “helps alleviate common issues that
        arise when organising to go out to the cinemas.” This began in our first group meeting where we
        brain stormed ideas together. We all came to the conclusion that we were able to relate to the
        problems that our aim is trying to resolve, thus we agreed on pursue this idea. We had come up with
        multiple different plans and ideas, however they didn’t solve problems we were passionate about,
        nor did we fully understand the issues some of those ideas were trying to solve. With the skills and
        research involved by all members of the group, we have succeeded in finding the common issues
        involved with researching movies at our local cinemas. This stems around the fact that most current
        cinema websites don’t offer all the details their users may want in the one place, but rather they
        have to go to multiple websites to gather all the data and information they need. We are finalising
        the planning stages of our project, then we will be moving onto the design stage and then the
        development stages. We plan on gathering feedback in-between each of these stages from our
        target audiences through the use of surveys and interviews. From exploring ideas in this planning
        stage, we came across multiple dead-ends as our current skills and budget, limit our capabilities in
        developing this sufficiently. Because of these limitations we aren’t going to be able to implement
        certain features that require the help of lawyers and professional programmers. Our group can
        succeed in this project to an extent; however, we have many more stages ahead of us where more
        issues may arise.</p>
        <br>
        <p align="center" >We have currently refined the set of features that this chatterbot will release with. After much
        discussion, we have concluded that it will be able talk and reply to the user, outputting information
        based on what the user has inputted. For example, when requested, we plan on it being able to
        bring up movie times, reviews, ratings from critics and audiences, available trailers, book tickets, and
        all other information about the movie. The movie information section would include its description,
        actors involved, genre, and the classification of the movie. We decided on these set of features as
        this is how most users determine what movie they are going to watch. We believe it is important to
        display this information as users will compare it to their normal preferences of favourite actors,
        genres and so on.</p>
        <br>
        <p align="center" >Our team will be able to complete this project through programming in java and by designing the
        user interface. Having a good user interface is important as we don’t want to make it more difficult
        for our users to find this information, in-comparison to just searching up the information themselves
        through other websites. We plan on it being simple, intuitive, and overall an easy to use application
        for all age groups, including those who may be tech-illiterate. This application will also be able to
        guide those /who still find difficulty in using the program as they can refer to the “help” section of
        the app. The programmers in the group will be developing both the feature set and the inner
        workings of the chatterbot, specifically in the way it communicates to the user. This includes having
        multiple different greetings, displaying information in a uniform clear manner, and lastly
        acknowledging and processing the requests of the user. Through the use of eclipse, this application
        would ideally retrieve regular updates on the movies set times and will be able to properly book a
        ticket with the desired cinema. Our budget does limit our capabilities of getting help from external
        sources such as lawyers and getting the proper permissions to use the websites data. To overcome
        this, setting up a crowd funding campaign may help us alleviate these problems and will allow us to
        hire professional programmers that can ensure the robustness and functionality of our application.
        Without the proper funding, we still plan on creating an application that can do our set tasks but
        won’t be able to be released to the public due to legal concerns. This includes getting permission to
        use trailers in the app, permissions to gather data about the movies from other websites, and how
        we save and store our user’s data that won’t break any laws.</p>
        <br>
        <p align="center" >The project was first initiated when our group was first brainstorming ideas about what type of
        application we wanted to make. On our first discussion of the topic, when our group had an extra
        fourth team member, we each contributed multiple different ideas. These ranged from creating
        applications that would help you in your studies, a guide to finding your way around universities,
        fitness apps and more. All of these ideas were fine however we weren’t satisfied with them due to
        the fact that we could already think of multiple applications that existed for them. We did not go
        into this brain storming session with the intention of creating something original, but once we
        thought of our idea, we were sold. It was something we all could relate to as being young adults we
        go out a fair amount of times throughout our semesters in order to find a sense of escapism. We all
        agreed that we usually do have to visit our local cinema’s website, as well as other sites such as
        “YouTube” and “Rotten Tomatoes,” in order to be able to gather all the information needed in order
        to select the best possible movie that we would like to see. Having everything all in one place in one
        place in a form of a chatterbot has the potential to save users time as our planned application will
        have the functionality of being able to present all the information from these websites, in the one
        place.</p>
        <br>
        <p align="center" >After the brainstorming stage, we started with our planning. If this were to be a project we were to
        complete, then we would have gotten feedback from our audiences to see if this is an application
        that they would use personally. From here we progressed to planning out all of the functionalities of
        the chatterbot, what it can and cannot do, depending on our strengths and weaknesses as a team.
        Due to this, we currently have only been able to reach the near end of the planning stage. One
        particular dead end we ended up following stemmed from our ignorance of not knowing our limits,
        making us have to change certain elements of our project plan. Specifically, we were planning on
        adding features that were out of our scope and capabilities. If we had our ideal group that was
        designed in the “Skills and Jobs” section of our planning, then these desired features would have
        been made possible. These include having the chatterbot remember previously sent messages from
        the user, allowing it to understand the context of the conversation. This is a feature that has only
        just been recently implemented by the biggest technology companies in the world in their assistants.
        Our group of three people would not have been able to accomplish this on our own and thus we had
        to scrap certain ideas such as this.</p>
        <br>
        <p align="center" >During our journey, we had to make an important decision that would affect the outcome of our
        project. Our group was handicapped due to the absence of one of our team members who decided
        to defer from his studies for a semester, leaving us with a group of three people. We all made the
        decision to keep the group small, instead of outsourcing and finding another person to join our
        team, or to merge with another team. This decision was made as having too many team members
        involved in a project like this, would cause more issues than it will solve. We discovered this notion
        as we knew we weren’t going to go ahead with the development stage of the application, making
        the team leaders job to constantly update a big group of people on what our application is going to
        do. We believed this would make it difficult to make sure everyone in the group is on the same page
        and thus we decided that a group of three people would be sufficient enough to complete the
        planning stages of the project. This guarantees us that our vision of our project won’t be
        compromised due to disagreements, lack of effort and other common issues that arise in large
        teams.</p>
        <br>
        <p align="center" >As we finalise our planning, our group is preparing for the next stages of development. Having
        explained what has been done, why we have done it and what we are and aren’t going to do, we
        now need to focus and keep communicating with one another through meetings on “Microsoft
        Teams.” This ensures that all future problems that may arise throughout the other stages of this
        project, will be addressed in a timely manner, allowing us to discuss as a group how we can solve
        and overcome these issues. This is where having a small team may be more beneficial as we will all
        be constantly in check with each other, on what stages we are all up to, even if it means the
        development process will be slowed down due to heavier workloads.</p>
