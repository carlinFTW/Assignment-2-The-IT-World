	<p align="center">From the past few weeks spent working together on this assignment, there are always
        things that worked well and things that could be worked on. One thing that worked was
        that work was allocated fairly and responsibly, in that the member’s consent, strengths as
        well as their workload in the assignment was taken into account. One example of the
        group’s weaker points is that there were only meetings outside of allocated times.</p>
    <br>
	<br>
    <p align="center">Amongst the positives and negatives of the group, it was surprising to find that such
        projects require more work and planning than I had anticipated. There are regular meetings
        that are held even after the defining of the product, to merely check on current progress,
        answer any inquiries, discuss any issues found as well as any solutions to newly found
        issues.</p>
    <br>
	<br>
    <p align="center">Overall from my experiences with this group, I’ve learnt that groups require some form of
        leadership to function well; however, such leadership doesn’t always guarantee the best
        group dynamic. Bouts of individual member independence also contribute to group
        dynamics, therefore, it’s both leadership and member independence that aides in the
        success and function of the group.</p>
